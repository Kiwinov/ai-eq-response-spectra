# Conditional GAN for Earthquake Response Spectrum Generation

This project implements a **Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)** to generate earthquake acceleration data in the log-frequency domain (**response spectra**).  
The model is trained using a **novel composite loss function** combining:

- **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)** â€” for adversarial training.
- **Smoothness Regularization** â€” to ensure realistic log-frequency-domain curves.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** â€” to match ground truth response spectra.

On the entire test set, the model achieved an **RÂ² score of 0.9121**, demonstrating strong predictive capability.

## ðŸš€ Installation

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast Python dependency management.  
You must have **Python 3.9+** installed.

### 1. Install `uv`
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
````

Or, if using Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
```

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/earthquake-cgan.git
cd earthquake-cgan
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

## ðŸ§  Training

1. Place your earthquake response spectrum data in the `data/` folder.
   Data should be in the form of **period (s)** vs. **log(acceleration)** values for each record.
2. Run the training script:

```bash
uv run python src/train.py
```

3. Checkpoints will be saved in the `models/` directory.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation

To evaluate the model on the test set:

```bash
uv run python src/evaluate.py
```

This will print metrics including **RÂ² score** (expected: \~0.9121 on the provided test set).

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Generation

To generate new response spectra conditioned on input labels:

```bash
uv run python src/generate.py --label_file path/to/labels.npy --output_dir generated/
```

The generated spectra will be output as **period (s)** vs. **log(acceleration)** arrays.

## ðŸ›  Novel Loss Function

The total loss function used in training is:

```
Loss = BCE_GAN + Î»â‚‚ * SmoothnessLoss + Î»â‚ƒ * MSE
```

Where:

* `BCE_GAN` â€” binary cross-entropy for adversarial training.
* `SmoothnessLoss` â€” penalizes large second derivatives to encourage smooth spectral curves.
* `MSE` â€” enforces similarity to ground truth spectra.
